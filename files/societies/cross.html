<p>Robinson has a strong reputation for Distance Running, Cross Country and Athletics. Alumni include Alex Short who won the Blues Varsity match and raced for Great Britain in the European Cross Country Championships. Our Men’s team is currently ranked top in the University for Cross Country, with a number of Blues standard runners.  The academically central location of Robinson, along with the athletics track nearby at Wilberforce road, makes it an ideal location for balancing training and work. There are numerous traffic free paths around Robinson, and since there is such a relatively high number of runners, there will always be someone to train with. The other significant advantage of RCCCA is the fact that accommodation is guaranteed for 3 years on the main college site, which means you won’t have to move to an inconvenient location as happens with some colleges in the old centre of Cambridge. Getting to sessions or joining University training runs is therefore convenient and easy for your entire time here, an advantage when trying to effectively balance academia and sport to a high level.  If you are a serious runner, from short to long distance, then studying at Robinson will allow you to train hard  with a strong community of athletes who are all dedicated and passionate about the sport.</p>
