<p>The Christian union is a lively community who seek to give everyone the opportunity to hear about Jesus. We meet to pray read the bible and support one another to grow in our faith. There is a family atmosphere across year groups which is great fun. Look out for our events open to everyone throughout the year e.g. freshers' breakfast , text a toastie and cricket &amp; bbq. These events are great for building community, asking any questions about Christianity and having a fun time with friends.</p>
