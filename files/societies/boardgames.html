<p>Robinson is lucky enough to have one of the largest board game collections in the university. As well as your “classic” board games, such as Monopoly, Twister and Risk, we also have many modern party games like Exploding Kittens, and yes, Cards Against Humanity, and some more interesting newer games such as Ticket to Ride, Catan and Betrayal at House on the Hill. Any Robinson student is free to borrow any of our games at anytime, but we also meet regularly for a relaxed board games evening lasting a couple of hours, where you can definitely find someone to play with or to teach you a new game - an excellent way to relax after a hard day’s work!</p>
