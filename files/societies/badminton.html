<p>There are lots and lots of sports societies you can join at Robinson but Robinson ladies’ badminton club is a way to do a bit of exercise and also have fun! We meet only once a week for a couple of hours where you can practice your technique and play games with each other. All abilities are welcome and we are a very relaxed club (you don’t have to commit to going every week), which makes the badminton club a great society to join for individuals who didn’t do much sport before university but would like to start. However, if you are a sports-fanatic and love playing competitively, you should also join! During the first and second term, we play matches against some of the other colleges at Cambridge. We play in doubles and three pairs play per match – so you are never playing alone! We also have socials, where we go out for dinner or to a bar with other teams.</p>
