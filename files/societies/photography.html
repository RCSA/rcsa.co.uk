<p>Robinson’s photography and art society has something for just about everyone: whether you are artistic and want to keep up a hobby by sharing your work with other people in our weekly meetings, or simply want to borrow a camera that’s better than your mobile.</p>

<p>For each of our weekly meetings there is a theme (such as “black and white” or “nature”) that encourages you to experiment and be creative before showing and discussing your results. The aim of these meetings is to allow people to continue with their artistic interests outside of their subject and as such they are open to anyone of any ability and are very informal and supportive.</p>

<p>If you aren’t bothered about the weekly meetings then the society also runs a competition each term, takes photos at many of the events around college (including the bops) and has a selection of cameras that can be borrowed (including a Go-Pro).</p>
