<p>Robinson College Tea Society informally began through a group of friends meeting up with each other throughout term-time to take a much needed break from the fast-paced Cambridge environment, over cups of tea. With a growing tea collection (with SO many flavours from traditional English Breakfast to chocolate to chai to sweet chilli to chamomile), and a growing awareness of a shared love for tea around college, Tea Society Presidents David Lowis and Georgie Edmonds decided to make drinking tea a formal part of student life at Robinson. Tea Society meets regularly during term time and provides a relaxed and informal space for students to meet up, drink tea and look after each other when times get stressful! Tea Society also holds a special mid-term campaign where we deliver anyone in need of a tiny tea pick-me-up a special tea bag of their choice to their pigeon hole. Tea truly makes life better, and Tea Society makes sure that when anyone is in need of a liquid hug, we are there, spreading the tea love one tea-bag at a time.</p>
