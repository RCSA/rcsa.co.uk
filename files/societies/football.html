<p>Robinson has a very active football scene with three teams playing on a weekly basis. All abilities are welcome and can be catered for, so it doesn't matter whether you have never kicked a ball in your life or whether you've been playing for as long as you can remember. From personal experience I can say that college football is a great way to keep yourself fit in a social way and vent pent-up frustration from the working week. It also allows you make friends from across different year groups and really participate in a team ethic that adds a lot to university life. It's definitely worth getting involved with. Last year the team won cuppers for the first time â€“ a massive achievement for the college, and another reason to get involved in the Robinson football team. </p>
