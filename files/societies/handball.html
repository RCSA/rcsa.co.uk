<h4>When and where does your society/team meet?</h4>
<p>We have training sessions every Saturday from 6-8pm in the University Sports Centre. This might change next year, but will be announced on the clubs facebook page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CUHandball/">https://www.facebook.com/CUHandball/</a>)</p>
<hr />

<h4>What do you do?</h4>
<p>Handball, of course. A fast and physical ball sport known all across Europe except for the UK. </p>

<hr />
<h4>Does your team play in a league or cuppers?</h4>
<p>We have multiple friendly matches during the year, participate in the UK University Championships, and play Varsity against Oxford. There is an option for advanced players to play in a UK league as well.</p>

<hr />
<h4>What roles are there?</h4>
<p>There are five different positions you can play: A strong pivot, tall back-shooters, tactical centre player, technically skilled wingers, and a fearless goalkeeper.</p>

<hr />
<h4>What ability does someone need to join?</h4>
<p>Two hands is a good start, otherwise we will surely find a suitable position for you. Even if you have never played before. </p>

<hr />
<h4>What equipment is provided? What personal kit does someone need?</h4>
<p>Regular sports clothes are necessary (including indoor sports shoes). Everything else is provided by the club.</p>

<hr />
<h4>Are there any costs?</h4>
<p>Cost are termwise: 20£ for a single term, 35£ for two terms, and 50£ for the whole year. This is pretty much spent completely for booking the hall.</p>
