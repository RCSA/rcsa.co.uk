<p>I'm Matt, and as LGBT+ officer my job is to represent and campaign on behalf of everyone in the Robinson community whose identity is covered by LGBT+ umbrella. The RCSA and the students of Robinson are proud of our inclusivity, and itâ€™s my role to make sure we hold ourselves to high standards on all issues to do with gender identity and sexuality. I also organise social events within college and with other colleges aimed at LGBT+ people. I also run weekly drop-in sessions on Mondays from 3-4pm in my room, L11.</p>
