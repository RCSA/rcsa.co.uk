<p>Robinson has loads active societies, sports (rowing, hockey, football, rugby, cricket, water polo and many more), music, film, theatre and many more. I loved my time here so far and honestly would not want to be anywhere else</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Robinson I’ve found the perfect balance between the “real world” and the sort of Cambridge dream that I envisaged prior to arriving here. Not only are you receiving a first-class education but you’re also in a space where it’s really easy to remove yourself from the grandeur of Cambridge when needs be. I feel really lucky to be surrounded by so many brilliant people. Instead of feeling intimidated, I’m motivated to improve alongside the great minds around me and use that knowledge in a really applicable way. I’ve developed the confidence to really express myself. There’s an atmosphere of normality here that strikes the perfect balance; a space that you can thrive in regardless of social background. I think that’s really rare no matter what university you’re at. Choosing Robinson is one of those decisions I’ll thank myself for, now and in years to come.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Robinson College truly feels like a second home, when I get home I miss the red bricks and can’t wait to come back. The café and gardens are my favourite places – the gardens are well maintained and lovely to spent time in when its summer. The Red Brick café is also a favourite hangout, the staff here are so friendly and the café it is a really convenient place to work and socialise – something which a lot of other colleges don’t have.</p>
