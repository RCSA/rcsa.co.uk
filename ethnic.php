<p>Hey! I'm Sneha, your ethnic minorities officer. I am basically here to represent all the ethnic minority students in Robinson and help with their welfare. That includes things like holding drop-ins and organising social events that both ethnic minority and non-ethnic minority students can attend. The drop-in sessions are held every Friday at 4pm to 5pm in my Room, E1. Everything brought up in the sessions would be confidential. If the drop-in time is inconvenient for you, just drop me an email at <a href="mailto:diversity@rcsa.co.uk">diversity@rcsa.co.uk</a> and I'm happy to arrange another meeting time. </p>
