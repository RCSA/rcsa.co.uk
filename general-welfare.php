<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm Gabrielle McGuinness, the College Welfare Officer which involves many duties, but all to do with maintaining and improving the health and wellbeing of Robinson College students. Aside from this, I am an English second year who is obsessed with all things cultural, clothes, coffee, dogs and feminism.</p>

<p>One of the other key aspects of my job is to be there to support students throughout their degree, which is why I run my weekly drop-in sessions but I can also be emailed to arrange a meeting at any time. Raising awareness of mental health issues is one of my key passions and I will be doing this by organising fortnightly discussion groups headed by the Welfare sub-committee on pertinent issues, such as mental health, LGBT+ rights, racism and tackling gender issues. I want to create an open dialogue within college regarding these issues and hopefully tackle stigma against mental health. I also will be doing this behind the scenes by liaising with senior staff and trying to improve college relations and welfare provisions.</p>

<p>For this year, I am the Queen of Condoms. I will be handing out C-Cards in the Cafe for an hour every week, which I will tell you about in my weekly bulletin email. I will also ensure that the Welfare locker is replenished regularly for your emergency needs. If you need any other supplies or sexual health related advice, I am the one to contact.</p>

<p>Since we all tend to feel a little tired or losing motivation by Week 5, I am going to try and change things by running more welfare related events. This will involve cake, music, comedy and general fun that will allow us to remember to relax and enjoy our studies, rather than be defeated by them. Last term we ran a highly successful Christmas party in the JCR, which we hope will become tradition.</p>

<p>Stay positive and I am here to help whenever! Much love x.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<h3>In-college resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Gabrielle</b>, <b>Cammy</b>, <b>Dan</b>, <b>Matt</b>, <b>Sneha</b>, <b>Louise</b> form the rest of the welfare team so feel free to contact us at any time. We are all obliged to keep everything you say confidential.</li>
  <li>Your <b>TUTOR</b>: Your tutor should be there for you on a pastoral level but you can also go to <strong>ANY</strong> other tutor in college. You can also change your tutor at any time if you feel they are not right for you. Tutors are bound to a confidentiality agreement and so you are safe to speak to them. The list can be found on page 43 of the Junior member handbook <a href="http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/assets/about/junior_members_handbook.pdf">http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/assets/about/junior_members_handbook.pdf</a>.</b></li>
<li>Although technically meant to stay academic, it can be important to keep you DoS in the loop about certain issues, many students prefer to speak to their DoS regarding some problems, especially if they feel it relates to their subject.</li>
