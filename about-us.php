<p>The RCSA is the Student's Association at Robinson College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>The two primary purposes of the RCSA are to represent student views to the college authorities and to support student welfare. The RCSA Committee consists of 19 elected positions. Election of the new committee takes place half way through the first term ('Michaelmas Term') each year, and Robinson has recently had a very high turnout in student elections. All junior members of the College are eligible to vote in these elections, meaning that the student committee is well and truly responsible to those who elected it. More information about this can be found in our <a href="/documents">Constitution</a>.</p>

<p>The RCSA is responsible for maintaining student facilities in college, as well as running an exciting variety of college 'ents'. The RCSA also is responsible for supporting and financing societies within Robinson, including the Choir, the Brickhouse Theatre, and of course, the Boat Club. RCSA Representatives sit on a variety of College Committees, including College Council, and are therefore able to communicate student views to the governing body of the College through both formal and informal channels.</p>

<p>The RCSA also provides a Welfare Team, with specialised officers for Women, Men, LGBT, Ethnic Minority and Overseas Students, headed by a Welfare Officer. They are able, with the rest of the Committee, to offer support and help wherever needed, as well as running 'chillout' sessions during stressful periods like exam term!</p>

<p>Finally, the RCSA works with CUSU (Cambridge University Students' Union), and student unions at other colleges, to ensure co-operation across a range of issues affecting students throughout the University. CUSU is also able to provide further welfare assistance.</p>

<p>The pages on this site provide an introduction to the Committee, and our specific responsibilities, as well as the way college politics works. If you've got any more questions, have a look at the 'Meet the Committtee' page and contact the person who seems most relevant.</p>

<p>There is also infomation about Open Meetings, reports on what the committee have been up to, a brief summary of what college committees exist and what they do, our wonderful Constitution, and much much more!</p>
